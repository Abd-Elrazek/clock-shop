## Introduction
On a weekend, I saw a great clock code on the [codepen](https://codepen.io/) website. So I had an idea, why not collect these beautiful clocks and share them with everyone? Good things always have to be enjoyed by more people!

All the code comes from the [codepen](https://codepen.io/) site. They are really great. I want to pay tribute to the original author.

## Content
